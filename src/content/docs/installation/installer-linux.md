title: Installation via installer (GNU/Linux)
---

## Installation steps

### 1. Run the installer

To install Ferron web server, run the following command:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://downloads.ferronweb.org/install.sh)"
```

You will be prompted to choose the installation type, and possibly whenever to install packages containing `unzip` and `setcap`.

### 2. Access the web server

By default, Ferron serves content from the `/var/www/ferron` directory. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost` to verify that the server is running and serving the default `index.html` file.

## File structure

Ferron installed via the installer for GNU/Linux has following file structure:

- _/usr/sbin/ferron_ - Ferron web server
- _/usr/sbin/ferron-passwd_ - Ferron user management tool
- _/usr/lib/libferron_mod\_\*.so_ - dynamically linked modules that can be loaded by Ferron
- _/var/log/ferron/access.log_ - Ferron access log in Combined Log Format
- _/var/log/ferron/error.log_ - Ferron error log
- _/var/www/ferron_ - Ferron's web root
- _/etc/ferron.yaml_ - Ferron configuration

## Updating Ferron

You can update Ferron to the latest version using the `ferron-updater` command.
