We are excited to introduce Ferron 1.0.0-beta10, packed with enhancements and important fixes.

### Fixed bug with "userList" and "users" property validation for non-standard codes
Resolved an issue where the `userList` and `users` properties were incorrectly validated for non-standard codes.

### OCSP stapling enabled by default
The server now enables OCSP stapling by default, improving TLS security and reducing the need for client-side certificate validation requests.
