We are excited to introduce Ferron 1.0.0-beta9, where we have fixed a bug related to CGI (Common Gateway Interface).

## Key improvements and fixes

### Improved CGI execution handling
The server now uses the directory containing the executed CGI program as the working directory for the CGI program. This change fixes issues where certain CGI applications, such as YaBB, would fail to start.

## Thank you!

We appreciate all the feedback and contributions from our community. Your support helps us improve Ferron with each release. Thank you for being a part of this journey!
