We are excited to introduce Ferron 1.0.0-beta4, packed with new features, enhancements, and important fixes.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Option to disable backend server certificate verification

Added an option to disable backend server certificate verification for the reverse proxy, improving flexibility for deployments with self-signed or internal certificates.

### Enhanced HTTPS environment variable support

Added support for the CGI/SCGI/FastCGI "HTTPS" environment variable, ensuring better compatibility with various web server configurations.

### Configuration reload without full restart

Added support for configuration reloading without entirely restarting the server via a "SIGHUP" signal, reducing downtime and improving server management.

### Improved virtual host resolution for HTTP/2

Fixed an issue where virtual host resolution was not working for HTTP/2 connections, ensuring correct routing and domain handling.
