We are thrilled to announce the release of Ferron 1.0.0-beta1, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of our web server technology. This release not only brings a host of improvements and fixes but also introduces a new identity for our project. Let's dive into the key changes and enhancements that set Ferron 1.0.0-beta1 apart from its predecessor, Project Karpacz 0.7.0.

## Key Improvements and Fixes

### Enhanced Directory Listings and Error Pages

One of the notable improvements in Ferron 1.0.0-beta1 is the correction of directory listings and certain server error pages that were previously displaying HTML as plain text. This fix ensures that users receive a more polished and professional experience when interacting with the server.

### Improved URL Rewriting and Configuration Handling

We have addressed issues related to per-host URL rewriting and non-standard code configuration. These fixes enhance the server's flexibility and reliability, making it easier for administrators to manage and customize their web server settings.

### Resolved Redirect Loop Issue

The `wwwroot` configuration property, which was causing a redirect loop in earlier versions, has been fixed. This resolution ensures smoother navigation and better performance for users accessing the web server.

### Rebranding to Ferron

In a move that reflects our commitment to innovation and growth, we have rebranded our web server from "Project Karpacz" to "Ferron." This new identity signifies a fresh start and our dedication to providing top-notch web server solutions.

### Streamlined Directory Listings

The directory listings in Ferron 1.0.0-beta1 no longer display a return link for the website root directory. This change simplifies the user interface and makes it more intuitive for users to navigate through directories.

### Alphabetical Sorting of Directory Entries

To enhance usability, the entries in the directory listings are now sorted alphabetically. This feature makes it easier for users to find and access the files they need quickly.

## Looking Ahead

The release of Ferron 1.0.0-beta1 is just the beginning of an exciting journey. We are committed to continuously improving our web server technology and addressing the needs of our users. Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as we work towards the full release of Ferron 1.0.0.

We invite you to try out Ferron 1.0.0-beta1 and experience the difference for yourself. Your feedback is invaluable to us as we strive to make Ferron the go-to web server solution for developers and administrators alike.

Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to serving you with Ferron!
