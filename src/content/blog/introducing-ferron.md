## A New Era for High-Performance Web Serving

We are thrilled to introduce **Ferron**, a fast, memory-safe web server written in Rust. Formerly known as _Project Karpacz_, Ferron has been rebranded and is now moving towards its **beta release**. Designed to be lightweight yet powerful, Ferron brings modern web serving capabilities with a strong emphasis on **speed, security, and reliability**.

## Why Ferron?

The web server landscape is filled with well-established solutions, so why build another one? The answer lies in three core principles that Ferron embodies:

- **Performance** – Built with Rust’s zero-cost abstractions and highly efficient concurrency model, Ferron delivers exceptional speed and low resource consumption.
- **Memory Safety** – Thanks to Rust’s ownership model, Ferron eliminates entire classes of memory vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and use-after-free errors.
- **Feature-Rich Yet Lightweight** – Ferron packs modern features without unnecessary bloat, making it an ideal choice for both small-scale and enterprise-grade applications.

## Features of Ferron

Ferron already boasts a robust set of features, making it a compelling alternative to traditional web servers:

- **Static File Serving** – Serve files efficiently with minimal overhead.
- **HTTPS with Automatic TLS** – Secure your connections effortlessly with built-in TLS support.
- **HTTP/2 Support** – Improve performance with multiplexed streams and reduced latency.
- **Reverse Proxy & Forward Proxy** – Handle backend services and client requests efficiently.
- **Load Balancing** – Distribute traffic across multiple backend servers.
- **Caching** – Reduce response times with caching mechanisms.
- **CGI, SCGI, and FastCGI** – Support for legacy and modern CGI-based applications.

## The Road Ahead

As we approach the **beta release**, our focus will be on refining Ferron’s performance, improving documentation, and expanding real-world use cases. We aim to provide a seamless developer experience while maintaining **security and stability as top priorities**.

In the coming weeks, we will share more updates, benchmarks, and guides to help you get started with Ferron.

## Join the Ferron Community

Ferron is an open-source project, and we welcome contributors, testers, and feedback from the community. Whether you are looking for a lightweight web server for your personal projects or need a high-performance solution for production workloads, Ferron is built to meet your needs.

Stay tuned for the beta release, and let’s build the future of web serving together!
