We are excited to introduce Ferron 1.1.0, packed with enhancements and new features.

## Key improvements and fixes

### Experimental support for HTTP/3

Ferron now includes initial support for HTTP/3, offering improved performance and reliability over modern networks. This feature is currently experimental and may require additional configuration for optimal results.

### Support for HTTP-01 ACME challenge

Automatic TLS is now easier than ever with added support for the HTTP-01 ACME challenge. This enables seamless certificate issuance and renewal through Let's Encrypt and similar providers.

### WSGI and ASGI support (optional)

Ferron 1.1.0 introduces support for both WSGI and ASGI applications, enabling greater flexibility for deploying Python-based web apps. **Please note:** this feature is not enabled by default. You must compile Ferron yourself to take advantage of this capability.
