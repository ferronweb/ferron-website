Welcome to the official website of Ferron, a fast, memory-safe web server written in Rust. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.

## Information We Collect

Our website is designed to respect user privacy. We collect only the following minimal information:

- **IP Address**: Collected for analytics and security purposes.
- **User Agent**: Collected to understand general browser and device trends.

We do **not** use cookies or any other tracking mechanisms beyond the minimal data collection specified above.

## How We Use Your Data

The data we collect is used solely for the following purposes:

- **Website Analytics**: We use Matomo, a privacy-focused analytics platform, to analyze visitor trends and improve our website. Matomo is configured to respect user privacy and does not use cookies.
- **Security Monitoring**: We may use collected IP addresses to identify potential security threats and ensure the stability of our website.

## Data Retention

We retain collected data for only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined above. We do not sell, share, or distribute this information to third parties.

## Third-Party Services

We do not share your data with external third parties, except as required by law. Our analytics provider, Matomo, is self-hosted and configured to anonymize data where possible.

## Your Rights

Since we collect minimal data, most traditional privacy rights (such as the right to access, delete, or modify data) may not apply. However, if you have concerns about your data, you may contact us at [privacy@ferronweb.org](mailto:privacy@ferronweb.org).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.
